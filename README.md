# Design Patterns in Software Development  

This repository contains typescript code examples that demonstrate the most common design patterns used in software development. Each pattern is organized into its category—creational, structural, or behavioral—and accompanied by a brief description of how it solves common design challenges.

## 📝 Introduction  
Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring software design problems. They provide templates for designing flexible, reusable, and maintainable code.

This project covers three major categories:
- **Creational Patterns:** Focus on object creation.
- **Structural Patterns:** Deal with object composition and relationships.
- **Behavioral Patterns:** Manage object interactions and responsibilities.

## 🛠 Categories of Design Patterns  

### 1. Creational Patterns  
- **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it.  
- **Factory Method:** Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type.  
- **Builder:** Constructs complex objects step-by-step.

### 2. Structural Patterns  
- **Facade:** Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces.  
- **Decorator:** Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects.  

### 3. Behavioral Patterns  
- **Observer:** Manages communication between objects where one change triggers updates in others.  
- **Strategy:** Allows algorithms to be selected at runtime.

## 🚀 Code Examples  
Each design pattern has its own directory with:
- A brief explanation of the pattern.  
- Code implementation in Typescript.
- Usage examples and test cases.
